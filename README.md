# Docker Compose Collection

This is where I store my collection of docker compose files. All compose files here are for personal use, but I put it in public anyway so that they are more accessible. If you want to use them, please feel free to do so. 

Files are structured in directories per purpose set as follows:

| Directory    | Purpose  |
|--------------|----------|
| ntfy          | ntfy compose file, Dockerfile, and configuration file  |
| automatisch  | Dockerfile and configuration file          |
| gitlab        | Dockerfile and configuration file for GitLab, with gitlab-runner and kroki          |
| nginx-proxy-manager | Dockerfile and configuration file for Nginx Proxy Manager          |
| mitmproxy     | Dockerfile and configuration file for mitmproxy          |


| Author       | Version  | Description | Date         |
